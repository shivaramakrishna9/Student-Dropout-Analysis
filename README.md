# Student Dropout Analysis System

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict student dropout rates in Gujarat, with a focus on understanding the socio-economic and academic factors influencing dropout patterns. By leveraging the dataset titled "Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success," the system provides insights into the demographic, economic, and academic variables that correlate with student retention or dropout.

## Problem Statement
The Government of Gujarat has identified a need for a comprehensive analysis of dropout patterns at the school level. With the help of this system, the government aims to identify high-risk groups, understand the underlying causes of dropouts, and implement targeted interventions to improve student retention.

## Key Features
- **Demographic Analysis**: Understanding the role of gender, age, marital status, and nationality in dropout rates.
- **Economic Factors**: Investigating the impact of parental occupation, tuition fee payment status, and scholarship eligibility.
- **Academic Performance**: Analyzing how curricular units and evaluations influence dropout probability.
- **Social & Special Needs**: Examining the impact of educational special needs and social challenges like debt or displacement.
- **Macro-economic Indicators**: Understanding how broader economic conditions like unemployment, inflation, and GDP growth relate to dropout rates.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for building the structure of the web application interface.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web pages and ensuring responsive design across devices.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for building the backend of the application, handling requests and processing data.
- **MySQL**: Used for storing and managing the data related to student dropout rates, including socio-economic, demographic, and academic details.
